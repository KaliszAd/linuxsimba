All you need to know about me is on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=147021940)

Well.. there 2 things I really don't like, that are worth mentioning 

First, is people asking me _"Where is your accent from?"_. As if they don't have an
accent.

Second, is the fact that I live in the richest country in the world, but a lot
of its children get a crappy education. In this area, I say Capitalism has
failed.

Enough politics, hope you enjoy my posts!
