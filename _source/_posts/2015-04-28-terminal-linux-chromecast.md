title: Linux Terminal in Chrome Browser - Chromecast
---

At work we have Chromecast setup in all conference rooms. Chromecast for Linux
does not cast the whole screen, just to a Chrome browser tab. How do I show my
terminal during a presentation?


**Solution**: install [butterfly](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/butterfly), a python based terminal emulation program.

Install it via ``pip install butterfly`` and follow the instructions on the
[website](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/butterfly)

I am experimenting with using ``tmux`` in this terminal emulator browser tab and
then only have 1 window open on my laptop to do web searches and write code.
Let us see how that goes.
