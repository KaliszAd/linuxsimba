title: Getting blog host name to use an IPv6 address
---

I have to admit, I'm not a DNS expert. I wish I was. I plan to setup an IPv6 network in my house soon.
So to get my feet wet, I setup my blog site with an IPv6 address.

* First, I got an IPv6 address for my blog server. This was not hard. Host Provider had easy to follow instructions. 

* Next, I went to my DNS provider's website, and added a **[AAAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URCcDM7eqDI)** record to my DNS zone file. Below is a snapshot of that information.

> I haven't found a good way to test this. I don't have native IPv6 at my house, yet! _(Thank you TWC!)_ Will post my solution whenever I figure it out.
